# MachineLearning

This is a machine learning library developed by Addison Shuppy for CS5350/CS6350

Each folder contains a run.sh file which runs each relevant python file in sequence.

# SVM

For Primal.py, if you would like to produce the numbers using the different parameters listed in Part 2 problem 2, I have commented out the previous ones.  Simply comment out the current parameters in SGD() and uncomment the desired ones.

Dual.py is used to compute the weights and bias. Since this code took 8+ hours to run, I have omitted it from run.sh. DualResults.py uses hard-coded values obtained by Dual.py to get prediction error.

Kernel.py is incomplete and has not been included in run.sh
